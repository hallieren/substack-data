# Many rules do not return Piecewise when it should

```python

In [8]: quadratic_pattern = y*x**2+z*x+t

In [9]: quadratic_pattern
Out[9]: 
     2        
t + x ⋅y + x⋅z

In [10]: integrate(exp(quadratic_pattern), x)
Out[10]: 
         2                 
        z                  
    t - ───                
        4⋅y     ⎛2⋅x⋅y + z⎞
√π⋅ℯ       ⋅erfi⎜─────────⎟
                ⎝  2⋅√y   ⎠
───────────────────────────
           2⋅√y

This is an issue because y could be zero, and such it should return a Piecewise with when it is zero

```python

In [11]: y = 0

In [12]: quadratic_pattern = y*x**2+z*x+t

In [13]: integrate(exp(quadratic_pattern), x)
Out[13]: 
⎧ t + x⋅z           
⎪ℯ                  
⎪────────  for z ≠ 0
⎨   z               
⎪                   
⎪   x      otherwise
⎩                   

In [14]: 
```

same for z

```python

In [2]: exp(quadratic_pattern)
Out[2]: 
      2  
 t + x ⋅y
ℯ        

In [3]: integrate(exp(quadratic_pattern), x)
Out[3]: 
    t           
√π⋅ℯ ⋅erfi(x⋅√y)
────────────────
      2⋅√y

Such examples currently include all special functions. Further tests need to be carried out to find all such cases.
